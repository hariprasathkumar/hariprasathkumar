### Guiding Principle

> “Don’t follow your passions, follow your effort.  
> Look at where you spend your time — that’s where your real interest lies.”  
> — [Mark Cuban, *Blog Maverick* (2012)](https://blogmaverick.com/2012/03/18/dont-follow-your-passion-follow-your-effort/)

GitHub repository is a record of steady practice — things I work on out of curiosity and persistence.  
There’s no specific goal beyond improving my understanding of how systems behave.  
Over time, effort has become its own feedback loop: progress fuels interest, and interest keeps the effort going.
